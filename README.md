# TempleApiWrapper

A simple API 'proxy' for the Temple OSRS API.

You'll have to run this proxy when you're streaming, this is how you get the data from Temple OSRS so it needs to be online at all times.


## Run the proxy

To run the proxy you can either run the code yourself or get a pre-released version of the proxy in the releases tab

If you choose to get the pre-released version, keep reading.

- Unzip the release zip file that you've downloaded
- Double click the .exe file
- Keep the proxy (cmd) open as long as you want to be able to receive new data

So if you want to show one of the leaderboards on your stream, keep the cmd open!
